#+TITLE: gnus-search-mu

An mu search engine for Gnus' search facility.

Of course mu is required and must be set up properly for the groups you want to search. This works
almost identically to the current notmuch engine.

* Enable
To start using it can be as simple as;
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/gnus-search-mu")
  (require 'gnus-search-mu)

  ;; Then, like any other gnus-search backend
  (custom-set-variables
   '(gnus-search-default-engines '((nnmaildir . gnus-search-mu))))
  ;; or
  (setq gnus-search-default-engines '((nnmaildir . gnus-search-mu)))
#+end_src

For configuration options see the header of [[./gnus-search-mu.el]]. It is designed to fit in with the
generic gnus-search design where possible.
